git 43 & 44   02-12-2014 (Openpli 20+git5)
- Changed keymapping to EPGSelectAction

git 42   01-12-2014 (Openpli 20+git4)
- Because of some changes in Openpli I had to change the mapping of the guide/info key. It should work on updated and non-updated receivers (Thanks Dima73 for the hint)

git 41   30-11-2014 (Openpli 20+git3)
- If stored speed in speed.txt = 0 then use the default speed of 250 to avoid a divide by zero error.

git 40   27-11-2014 (Openpli 20+git2)
- Added support for the new VU+ Zero (Thanks to 2boom)

git 39   23-11-2014 (Openpli's 20+git1)
- Restored the support for the Formuler F1 & F3
- Rearranged  the code a bit, now first starting with the least time consuming part, the kerneldump

git 38   19-10-2014
- Removed (temporarily?) the support for the Formuler F1 & F3 because on these models the process aborts with an error while dumping the kernel partition. I'm unable to "repair" it at the moment because I've no test machine to run some tests on it to determine the error.

git 31-36   5-10-2014
- Added support for the Ixuss One (Thanks Athoik!)
- made some stupid errors local in the lookuptable

git 30   01-10-2014
- Changed the Backupsuite.sh to correct handle the ET8500
- Corrected lookuptable.txt for the Atemio Nemesis

git t28 & 29   07-09-2014
- Changed the way of version numbering, now following the git numbers

git 27   04-09-2014
- Added support for the Miraclebox Mini, Twin and Ultra
